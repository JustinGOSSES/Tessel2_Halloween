# Tessel2_Halloween
#### Playground for creating a Tessel2+motion sensor+speaker+web server halloween project inside a plastic pumpkin

#### Experiments folders holds trials and working parts

#### speaking_pumpkin folder holds the lastest working prototype

## Equipment
- Tessel 2
- UE mini-boom blue-tooth (used audio jack instead of bluetooth) speakers
- USB to Audio jack adapter
- Audio jack plug male to plug male cord
- USB battery pack
- orange plastic pumpkin

## Equipment I might use on this project in the future
- Creative Live web cam
- iRig Cast microphone
- PIR motion sensor

## Capabilities and Basic Set-Up: 
- Uses a web application served on the tessel's access waypoint to control sounds
- I used an old phone to control the web application and either home wifi or phone hotspot to create the wifi for the tessel
- Plays three halloween-themed short noises in mp3 format
    - witches laughing
    - booming ghost saying booo!
    - chomping noises
- Uses text to speech capabilities of tessel-av library to say: 
    - *Hello. I am a tormented soul trapped in a plastic pumpkin. Do you want some candy. Do not be scared. I have kitkats and peanut butter cups*

---- this is a work in progress, I'll upate more later -------
